# KUKA RSI IO

This is a library for communication with the KUKA KRC4 robot controller over KUKA Robot Sensor Interface (RSI).

The setup is based on the package _kuka_experimental_ for ROS1:
[kuka_rsi_hw_interface](https://github.com/ros-industrial/kuka_experimental/tree/melodic-devel/kuka_rsi_hw_interface)

See KRL for more information on configuring the robot-side.
There is a chance this script is already installed on the controller.
If so, it should be sufficient to start the demo and then the robot script.
